# The Script of the Demo 

We decided to create an application with the goal of facilitating teachers' interaction with technology due to the problems they have been facing with the spread of the coronavirus.
There is no direct communication between teachers and students, so teachers can know the students' status, whether they are not focused or distracted and so on.
The teacher can confirm the student's understanding through a dashboard in the application by presenting specific questions at certain times during the class.
Through these questions, the teacher will be able to determine if there is a specific part that needs to be re-explained or if they can continue with their explanation.
The attendance will be calculated based on the number of correctly answered questions. If the student answers all the questions incorrectly, they will be marked as absent, and therefore, 
students will be more focused to earn attendance grades. The application is called "Memo Study."
